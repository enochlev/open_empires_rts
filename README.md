## About the Game

open_empires_rts is a browser-based real time strategy game where players build and upgrade their own empire. As a player, you will:
• Manage resources such as money, stone, iron, gold, diamond, wood, and hay  
• Upgrade and construct various buildings (e.g., Castle, Smithy, Barracks, Stables, Dock, Lumber Mill, Quarry, Mine)  
• Train and upgrade units including citizens, soldiers, archers, cavalry, and ships  
• Assign workers to production buildings to boost resource generation  
• Watch ongoing progress through dynamic progress bars and live updates

The game uses a Python web framework (rendering via Jinja templates) and is reverse-proxied with Nginx. It is designed to offer both production-level play and ease of further development.

## Future Improvements (v2)

• Use databases to store game state:  
  Implement a robust storage solution to permanently save player progress and game data.

• Create a more structured rules engine:  
  Enhance the game mechanics by formalizing the rules for building upgrades, unit training, and resource generation.

• Develop an enhanced UI and global map for each city:  
  Introduce a more user-friendly interface along with a global view of each city to improve game navigation and strategic planning.
